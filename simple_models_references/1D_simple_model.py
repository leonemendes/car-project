'''
This code defines the vehicle parameters, initial conditions, and simulation parameters at the beginning. 
It then defines the net force function, which returns the net force on the vehicle as a function of time. 
In this example, the net force is a constant 1000 N.

The code initializes arrays to store the position and velocity of the vehicle at each time step, and then 
loops over each time step to update the position and velocity using the Euler integration method.

Finally, the code plots the position of the vehicle over time using the Matplotlib library.

Note that this is a very basic example of 1D vehicle dynamics simulation, and you may need to modify the code 
to include more realistic vehicle parameters and net force functions.
